        </header>

        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            This project focuses on the automated detection and severity classification of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from medical images using deep learning. Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and early detection is critical to improving patient outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the detection stage, we employed Detectron2, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, to localize knee joints within radiographic images. Following detection, the extracted regions were passed into an Xception-based classification network, which was fine-tuned to assess osteoarthritis severity according to the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading system. The KL scale (grades 0–4) provides a standardized radiographic measure of osteoarthritis progression, ranging from normal to severe degeneration.
          </p>

          <p>
            By combining robust detection with fine-grained severity classification, this system provides a scalable AI-powered tool to assist radiologists and clinicians in diagnosing KOA and tracking disease progression. The pipeline is designed to reduce diagnostic workload, support consistent grading, and potentially enable large-scale population screening in both clinical and low-resource healthcare settings.
